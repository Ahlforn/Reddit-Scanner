# Reddit-Scanner

As my first C++ project, I decided to make a program that could scan and download pictures posted on Reddit. It seemed like a fun project and it can have it's uses. But most of all, this is a way of learning the ins and outs of C++. I should mention that Reddit Scanner utilizes Qt.

At it's current state, Reddit Scanner is still very much in the experimental stage. There are lots of bugs, memory leaks and some features that haven't been implemented yet. And I'm afraid code comments are lacking to say the least.

BUT, take a peak, take it for a spin if you would like, just keep in mind that this is a work in progress. Any constructive critism is very much welcome.
